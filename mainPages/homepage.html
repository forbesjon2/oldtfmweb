seven three eight one three eight one one eight seven seven three eight one oh three eighty one one [noise] you know last night after the program early this morning i'm reading the news and going through yeah never stopped the nature and the other one article after another from one news outfit after another trashing one or another uh donald trump's family members millennia trump now they want to know how she became an immigrant and legal citizen in the united states the new york times is on the case we have c._n._n. here exclusive f._b._i. counter intel investigating <unk> business deal then we have another outfit here let's see pushing his family business receive loans after a white house meetings then we have a new york magazine robert <unk> family in his cross hairs by jonathon <unk> no i had never seen anything like this uh my entire life not with any president and i was any presidential family not with any administration these people have done nothing to deserve this kind of treatment donald trump decided to serve the american people again we can disagree on issues and i'll get to some of the we disagree on that's not my point my point is it's not a crime for donald trump to be president it it's not a crime for his daughter who they relax on and there's subtle offered relies on to be in the white house it's not a crime but he married an immigrant who became the united states citizen it's not a crime that they've done business in russia it's not like they got huge payoffs like the clintons after all and yet look at all this it's endless it's day in and day out day in and day out can you imagine being donald trump you wake up in the morning you don't know what the next thing's gonna hit you and then they mark 'em for <unk> let me tell you why <unk> offending himself and he's defending his family watching it oh go on m._s._n._b._c. or c._n._n. or n._b._c. a._b._c. or c._b._s. talk again in the new york times or the washington post he's trying to communicate with he's trying to defend himself he's not politically correct but ladies and gentlemen neither is the lap neither are the media that things they've said about this man that things they're trying to do to his family allowed in in american history absolutely unparalleled no family should have to go through this they came into office very well see they didn't come into office they get well say like most of these but phones they're already very wealthy [noise] that'd be cars so wealthy had complicated investments in tax returns and so forth there being subjected to scrutiny don't you're not by a completely out of control rogue not so special council who only hires democrats to be honest that who is clearly out to destroy this president and destroy his presidency whose clearly doing james <unk> betting who's clearly doing adam shift betting that's right i said it was an attack and i don't need to hear tray galley that go far with a different day hairdo every day i think <unk> great shut up who cares [noise] how can you watch watch taken place here with a phony collusion argument born up the hillary clinton campaign used by the f._b._i. under the control of liberals trump haters media who hate trump used a trigger a special council by a special counselor who's best friends but call me enron enron rows and saying hey this is a set up this is set up that clinton campaign and the d._m._c. they're operatives all over washington d. c. including in the f._b._i. was that set up from day one as i said last year these fights a court judges they don't get to hide under the table and the ropes he's or federal judging federal district judges selected by not other than the chief justice of the united states fisherman their secret court as i say don't hannity last night they don't get these judges or every bit as guilty as the f._b._i. is there everybody's jodie is they hell arithmetic campaign and the dancing they sign on these warrants these are getting read the material carefully or they didn't care there would have been no espionage of the trunk campaign but for the price of judges and they extended not watch not twice three times three times remember the basis the probable cause for a warning a counter intelligence investigation number one that's the what the subject is an agent of a foreign government in this case it was quarter page and they claimed he was an agent uh russia number too he's likely to have our is committing crimes ladies in general the first one was issued two october's ago extended freak times he was survey out for an entire year as the united states department of justice brought a case against quarter page no 'cause there's no case the brain there's no case to bring the fact that the f._b._i. initiated this investigation was like all over the media in order to try and stop tromp from getting the nomination in order if i'm trying to stop prompt for winning the general election they pay the price of court one week before the election really two weeks before the election dish or the war and they did and that day before the general election it was reported by a website called haight street that day before this has been a set up if trump didn't win most of this would have gone away you're never would've heard the <unk> heard about certainly beyond the early reports you wouldn't hurt anymore but he won and i don't like it because for the administrative state the democratic party one in the same thing in the media he wasn't allowed to when he wasn't allowed to win this family ladies and gentlemen is being abused by the federal government that's family is being abused by the media there's families being abused by adam shift chuck schumacher and the democrats in a way that i've never seen before you bunker trump is over in south korea right for the olympics and reporter asks her about her dad and these allegations about the porno star and everything else and she [noise] classic she's respectful she says you know that's not appropriate to ask me did they ever ever chelsea clinton about her dad's affairs do they even ask her today no way and they never what ever they want to

of wasn't provider for full contact led you that issue a warrant to spy on an american citizen under the idea that the american citizen was an aging of russia who was likely to commit a crime and by the way that citizen quarter page last time i checked she hasn't been charged with anything [noise] if you're a job [noise] and we've had successive judges and this fight for court over a period of

expect the f._b._i. to investigate the f._b._i. but i <unk> i don't judge or serving his face like orange i just i make sure that conduct punching committed in front of them now let me let me tell you something to last april where my legal foundation filed secretly <unk> court because we don't have any say nobody has standing nobody really knows how this works and we said to the court hey hey josh guess what guess what just took place in your courtroom here's what we said you have the inherent jurisdiction to order and investigation of the f._b._i. to get answers to that number one last april have this court order orders been used by intelligent and law enforcement enemies or the federal government and say subterfuge survey all private citizens and at least one united states senator and we were thinking of sections of the time for political purposes number two did government officials seek wander more national security of surveillance florence from this court and say pre tax picking ducking investigation for the purpose of affecting an ongoing national presidential campaign and subsequent transition of an incoming president since last april number three when applying for this court for one or more warrants for this matter did the f._b._i. informed this court they did that apparently paint some of the expenses former british fi who preparing to go see a reportedly relied on at all or apart enhance the application to convince there's court issue i warren number four one applying tennis court this was last to the judge for one or more and more into this matter did the f._b._i. inform the sport that's i don't see a it reportedly presented in pursuit of one or more warrants had originally been prepared by the former british five point washington research firm conducting opposition research i guess the republican nominee for president united states donald jay trump this is important landmark legal foundation respectfully request the court the judge the price of josh sending in box by herself she should directing government they've completed vastly geisha and report is funny to the court within ninety days the court should also consider whether it's appropriate to ensure in order to all relevant federal law enforcement intelligence agencies they're shown cars as to why they should not be how many contempt for selling to protect the secrecy classified information i'm paying for someone to the court orders [noise] now do you know what the judge shedding response testified in court judge i went to listen to this april twenty five two thousand seventy this is rosemary call you the resigning josh keep in mind the judge is on the price of court or picked by the chief justice of the supreme court these are just recording tried just for the most part so they're existing federal court judge she wrote [noise] in this little water [noise] the court is received they pleading title motion for <unk> as a <unk> on and on and on <unk> on april twentieth blame that five days later he says although presented as a request to appear there is no matter pending before the court with respect to which section of parents would be proper and listen to me this one was extended three times that matter was still appearing before this court that's number one number two the court has ongoing jurisdiction to supervise uh conduct of attorneys the f._b._i. the justice department before the court penn penn [noise] may reach backwards even after eight cases being concluded in other words spice and jog and quite frankly was misdirected when she said no matter it's not before us anymore when it was still be for them and court like any federal court still has the power to re fat and hold people accountable she did nothing she did not calling the f._b._i. as far as we know she did not calling the justice department she did not asked for answers she did not asked for an investigation she didn't call to contend fearing nothing you know if that tells me something smells like iraq all right let's stop there um back like the point is this lady's <unk> federal judge has wide authority indiscretion to order an investigation into punish people who <unk> all the court you see when you lie to a judge or you present knowingly misleading material information to a job where you are met material information for the purpose of improperly influencing your court's decision the court has to defend the court because there must be respect for the court that is the system the judicial system what we have here in judge rosemary call you're among others the price of court judge in the first instance is a clique complete application of her role as a judge choose presented with this evidence by landmark legal al <unk> uh the foundation last april wait it out pretty soon simply doing we didn't have all the information and she's done nothing she didn't order hearing that we know of she has an order it anybody to explain themselves and then when the house intelligence committee newness among others says to that court we want to copy the application that was used to persuade you to issue your water she says well you have to get it from the executive branch the president can be classified and he can give it to you 'course will uh system but madam judge the comedian ask the president they ask you my question do you like this gentleman his why hasn't this judge done anything or the subsequent judges sitting as far as the court judges they're all federal district judges why hasn't this judge done anything to protect the integrity of that court the integrity of the rule of law understand there is no country party there is no balancing party in that courtroom it's the government and the judge that's it harder page didn't have a lawyer and even though it was going on [noise] trump campaign didn't have a lawyer they didn't know about this <unk> and they didn't know it was being used and so a judge has an enormous responsibility they have to be on their toes even more than they usually are in a federal court room the trial court when it comes to these <unk> this judge blew it and big time that's why she's defence that's why she's not transparent she's taken as far as we know no steps no steps to correct what's been <unk> and that is a big deal and i do the math but my family five hundred dollars

to come up for a reason for oh national <unk> well i have is nothing to do it uh so you're gonna have another reason what creates americans to actually last time i started we lost two hundred thousand american job that's a lot of families without ya okay though you gotta think of something what's bernie sanders say maybe i can buy his park talking point embrace celebrity embraced capitalism embraced the market system you're living in the greatest country in the face theorists with the greatest amount of wealth on the face your because we're capitalists say say i'm not proud capitalist otherwise you're going to sound like one of these marxist socialist professors at some university hey you know i'm not so sure and then the argument goes like that walmart we have to have a safety net oh we know we're going broke with our safety nets try we have a two hundred and twenty dollar unfunded liability that our children and grandchildren i have to swallow well beyond the safety net where redistributing wow redistributing wow then i got a color in there and i'm like i was concerned i miss conservative and say hey as long as you know what i believe in a universal minimum wage uh <unk> what is that so i find myself here mr producer often defending americanism private property rights entrepreneurship individual liberty it's the craziest day i'm saying and then people say oh just support creating jobs in america more than any protectionist on the face of the earth i do because <unk> they killed jobs everybody doesn't work in a steel mill everybody doesn't cut down trees and these are by the way very honorable men and women who do this and that's not even my point but there's <unk> men and women and all walks of life who worked very hard and different jobs in different ways using different towns you know they have a right to to work and live and feed their family for a little money aside they're not subsidize for the most part <unk> only hurt them for the most part terrorist attacks on the american people the money goes to the federal treasury it is like the least conservative thing imaginable well you know mark on our constitution there's terrorists really oh yeah no i didn't know but of course there are because that's how they funded the federal government essentially the west no federal income tax but the goal of terrorists is not the redistribute the well we're well beyond that we've so far left fewer capitalism in free market so it's not even funny you know mark i favor free markets but i want fair markets i favor free trade but i want fair trade guess what there is no such thing as fair trade what does that mean fair trade i don't really know what i mean while level playing field what does that mean tell me when we trade with a third world countries that a level playing field i i don't know what that means they accuse us all the time of stealing they're well they're minerals being colonialists an imperialist i guess they don't think it's fair trade and a level playing field and they're wrong of course we should embraced capitalism ladies and gentlemen look around you look at what we you your ancestors of create it wasn't socialism they gave us a electricity wasn't socialism they gave us clean running water wasn't socialism they gave us mobility through the automobile and motorcycles and trucks and so forth on airplanes it's not socialism that keeps food on ourselves in our grocery stores on supermarkets it's not socialism that puts a roof over your head it's not socialism the put food on the table so why

though it's expensive you know most of us aren't trained to do it we don't even know who to send the forms too and it's not an issue when it comes to a murder in this country these so called gum show loop holes so they just throw everything against the wall and of course since hassled countries in every country has never been held a gun maybe somewhat more than half this all sounds persuasive to them oh heck i'm low hobo cut the rope here we don't want loopholes go ahead and if we would have saved thousands of lives no wouldn't have saved thousands of lives if you'd get rid of the cafe saying

it also look look at look at uh what maybe you're looking at the basic stuff alright luck sheldon wish you well good call i appreciate it kelly waterford michigan on the market was in uh how are you um hi i'm mark how feeling better sound better um i i really don't understand tariffs that well but i keep hearing talk about them at all and i'm i'm wondering how <unk> impact will be for uh like <unk> <unk> is the federal government putting a excise tax on something that ship in do america from another country so let's just play along let's say twenty five percent and you're sending in a ton of steal from canada well on top of everything else that's charged for that steal to come in and there's already duties and everything else there's gonna be another twenty five per cent at it and then he comes into the united states and he goes into production to build other things and so forth but domestic steal companies can raise their prices too they may not raise it by twenty five percent because they want their prices to be somewhat lower and what's coming through the the uh the border but maybe they'll raise them ten percent the point is the pressure is to drive up the cost of this product and you drive it up and it resonate throughout the economy driving up prices you know always in every way in which that product is use your the end user kelly so if you buy canned soup a can of soda can of beer an automobile a hub cap uh penn uh a new piece of kitchen equipment uh a cop cake pan uh silverware which mostly isn't sober any of these think any of these things all of these things you need a new <unk> system the price will be substantially more you want to go out and buy a pickup truck or or a regular sedate and so forth the price will be substantially higher and it also contributes to inflation but you have businesses that are going to expand less that are going to produce last and they're going to lay off people who use these products and that's why every case which this has been done it's been a net loss for american jobs overall and that lost and it doesn't help these industries either you control seventy percent of the production of stealing the united states what the hell is it that's not enough sounds like a lot to me now how is this going to impact even our military well god <unk> and how that's what you make an excellent point i pointed this out the other day the military used as a hell of a lot of steel in tanks and helicopters jets and ships in uh in <unk> armament in armor rather and ah [noise] ah weapons and i'm in michigan so you're going to pour all this money into rebuilding the military and you're gonna have to take now big chunk out of that in order to in essence yes you're taxing the military 'cause it's the private sector that builds these things not actually the military and you drive up the costs so yes you'll have less <unk> less jets less of everything no question about it at all i didn't think it was a good anyways but yeah but if they're saying this is a national security concern isn't that a national security concerns ate it is it most definitely kelly excellent point thank you for your car harsher ladies in

        content: "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, there are some in the Democrat Party claiming they will use democratic socialism to run America. This will never succeed because it’s tyranny; what will succeed is liberty. I Pencil and Milton Friedman are the best ways to explain our economy. When you hear this think of how hard it is to run an economy and who in federal government will run our healthcare system? We need to fight for what belongs to us, fight against democratic socialism which should be called police state socialism. Also, the democrats have their sights on President Trump’s financial info and his children. Trump must say no and bring this all the way to the Supreme Court. Later, it's been 2 years of the Russian investigations and we have had nothing come from it. None of the arrests or criminal proceedings have been related to the President and any sort of collusion. Finally, just weeks before the FBI raided Michael Cohen office, he pitched a book praising Trump. He painted Trump in a positive light by saying the President wasn’t dumb, crazy or a liar.",
